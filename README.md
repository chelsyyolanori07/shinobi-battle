Okay first of all i am really thankful to God for letting me finish my first game project...
Also this is my first time to publish a public repository which is kinda a bit awkward but anyway i believe it's a part of my learning journey so there you go lol 

Second of all i just want to say thank you so much to Ed Sensei(https://github.com/Coloby) that patiently guides me and dealing with my silly lil code everyday hakajkj... You deserve all the good things in the world huhuhu

So yeahh this project is just a silly lil game that i made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because i am still really really a beginner.
I follow this tutorial on youtube in case you want to check it out (https://youtu.be/M6sA8fvMCuA?si=Je0-ktX6FKuwwvsV)

But because naruto is my favorite anime so i decided to make it into naruto game instead which is kinda makes me happy and enjoying the process of making this game into reality while learning javascript in the same time

Fun fact is that when i start making this game i never actually play any video games i am so sorry jsaskdk and i have 0 knowledge about javascript, not just that i never ever see any javascript code before as well
so yeahh i try to learn javascript through this project from scratch which is kinda scared me at first because i don't know the basic but as time pass by it kinda makes me realized that actually you know what coding is not that bad lol
I guess i kinda more enjoy doing it now even though sometimes "Code is doing me" instead of "Me doing the code" hahaha üíÄ 

Anyway this game contains some new features which are sadly you will not find in the youtube tutorial link before (my sensei said it's called over-engineering project), 
still my game is not perfect but at least you can find some new features inside of it in case you want to check it out here are the new features that probably you will find in my silly lil game which are:

1. Unlockable village feature which is unlocking specific village when the player reach certain level
2. For the enemy i use enemy character basis on clan inside that specific village (so the player will fight the enemy inside the village itself)
3. I fetch the enemy from Naruto API and here is the link (https://narutodb.xyz/)
4. When you play the game you will see the chakra bar and health bar in the UI
5. Level up system
6. Inventory item 
7. Abilities for player that can be used after the player reach certain level + the ability for enemy based on clan using enemy AI probability to decide when enemy will use their ability againts the player

I guess for now that's the features in my silly lil naruto game, feel free to play this game if you want to ( https://shinobi-battle.netlify.app/)..<br>
Honestly i am not sure if anyone reading this but if you do i just want to say "How you do that lol??"
so yeahh thank you so much for reading this and for passing by and check my first silly public lil respository project
i really hope you have a great day/night once again thank youuu so much don't forget to breathee :)

See you in Konoha......
I mean in the next project lol good luck with everything you put your mind into... 

Peace :)
